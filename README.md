Snailbrain: The Slowest ML "Framework"
--------------------------------------

This is a really weird project that I have started, where I am crazy enough to attempt making a somewhat functional framework for deep learning. Right now, it has basically nothing so far, but I hope this project can do a couple of things:

- Be able to implement simple, dense neural networks
- Convolutional networks
- Computational graphs
- Weird layer types, such as dropout layers and flatten layers

If you are looking for an actual framework, please dooooon't. This is just a learning experience. It may actually turn out to be useful, but who knows. It's called "snailbrain" for a reason. I may utilize Vulkan compute shaders in the future, but that's not a guarantee.
